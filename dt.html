Model the following Doctor’s information system as a graph model, and
answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider the doctors in and around Pune. Each Doctor is specialized in
some stream like Pediatric, Gynaec, Heart Specialist, Cancer Specialist,
ENT, etc. A doctor may be a visiting doctor across many hospitals or he
may own a clinic. A person can provide a review/can recommend a
doctor.
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
draw a high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model. [3]
3. Answer the Queries
a. List the Orthopedic doctors in ……. Area. [3]
b. List the doctors who has specialization in ____ [3]
c. List the most recommended Pediatrics in Seren Medows. [4]
d. List all the who visits more than 2 hospitals [4]



# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the Doctor's information system graph model
use doctor_system_db

# Step 3: Create collections and insert data for doctors, hospitals, clinics, and reviews
db.doctors.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Dr. John Doe", specialization: "Orthopedic", clinic: "Ortho Clinic", hospital: ["MedCity", "Healing Touch"] },
  { _id: 2, name: "Dr. Jane Smith", specialization: "Pediatrics", clinic: "Pediacare", hospital: ["Happy Health", "Sunshine Clinic"] },

  { _id: 5, doctorId: 5, review: "Best pediatrician in the area.", rating: 5, recommender: "Sophia Harris" }
])

# Step 4: Write the queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the Orthopedic doctors in the given area (example: Pune)
db.doctors.aggregate([
  { $match: { specialization: "Orthopedic" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "hospitals",
    localField: "hospital",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "hospital_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$hospital_info" },
  { $match: { "hospital_info.location": "Pune" } },
  { $project: { name: 1, specialization: 1 } }
])

# b. List the doctors who specialize in a given stream, for example, Pediatrics
db.doctors.aggregate([
  { $match: { specialization: "Pediatrics" } },
  { $project: { name: 1, specialization: 1 } }
])

# c. List the most recommended Pediatrics in Seren Medows
db.doctors.aggregate([
  { $match: { specialization: "Pediatrics" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "reviews",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "doctorId",
    as: "review_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$review_info" },
  { $match: { "review_info.recommender": "Seren Medows" } },
  { $sort: { "review_info.rating": -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 },
  { $project: { name: 1, review_info: 1 } }
])

# d. List all doctors who visit more than 2 hospitals
db.doctors.aggregate([
  { $match: { $expr: { $gt: [{ $size: "$hospital" }, 2] } } },
  { $project: { name: 1, hospital: 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
